            <p>A pest is any living thing—a plant, an animal, or a microorganism—that has a negative effect on humans. It can be an unwanted plant (weed), fungi, nematode, microbe (such as bacteria or virus), insect, spider, mite, bird, fish, rodent, or even a deer. Labeling an organism a pest is a very subjective concept that varies with each individual’s point of view. In general, pests are unwanted or undesirable because they:
                <ul>
                    <li>reduce the availability, quality, or value of human resources such as food, feed, water, or space;</li>
                    <li>injure humans, animals, crops, structures, and possessions;</li>
                    <li>ossessions;</li>
                    <li>interfere with human activities by causing annoyance, discomfort, or inconvenience.</li>
                </ul></p>
