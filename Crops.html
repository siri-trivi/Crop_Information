            <p>Crops are the plants that we grow to provide us with food, fiber, and other essential materials. They include wheat, rice, corn, and cotton, among others. Farmers cultivate and care for these plants, and when the crops are ready, they are harvested and used to make various products like bread, clothing, and more. Crops are a vital part of our daily lives, as they give us the things we eat and wear.</p>
